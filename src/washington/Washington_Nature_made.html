    <h1> Nature made Objects </h1>
    <h3> Mount St. Helens </h3>
    <p> Mount St. Helens is primarily an explosive dacite volcano with a complex magmatic system. The volcano was formed during four eruptive stages beginning about 275,000 years ago and has been the most active volcano in the Cascade Range during the Holocene. Prior to about 12,800 years ago, tephra, lava domes, and pyroclastic flows were erupted, forming the older St. Helens edifice, but a few lava flows extended beyond the base of the volcano. The bulk of the modern edifice (above the 1980 crater floor) was constructed during the last 3,000 years, when the volcano erupted a wide variety of products from summit and flank vents. Historical eruptions in the 19th century originated from the Goat Rocks area on the north flank, and were witnessed by early settlers. New unpublished data on the timing for Mount St. Helens eruptive activity have been analyzed, which improves some of the eruption dates cited in published literature. This website contains the most up to date information. </p>

    <h3> Ape Cave </h3>
    <p> At 2.5 miles long, Ape Cave is the third longest lava tube in North America. Explore a chilly, pitch-black corridor deep beneath the forest floor of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. A short, paved trail leads to the entrance of the cave, where visitors must descend a series of staircases for self-exploration of the cavern. The 3/4 mile long Lower Cave is relatively easy and family-friendly; most visitors explore the Lower Cave in about an hour. For the more adventurous, the 1.5 mile Upper Cave involves scrambles over rock piles, scaling an 8 foot rock wall, and exiting a small opening in the ground surface before hiking 1.5 miles back to the entrance. The Upper Cave can take 2 hours or more to explore. Visitors must come prepared to explore the cave independently—there are no lights in the cave, so visitors must bring their own headlamps or flashlights. Cell phone lights are not adequate for the cave. </p>

    <h3> Dry Falls </h3>
    <p> Sun Lakes—Dry Falls State Park is an important part of the geologic history of Washington State. Few sites in eastern Washington better capture the cataclysmic nature of the geologic processes that have shaped the Columbia Basin. Have you ever imagined a waterfall that was five times the width and three times the height of Niagara Falls? The pathway of this massive waterfall can be seen clearly at Dry Falls, allowing visitors to travel back in time to the years of the great ice age floods. </p>
