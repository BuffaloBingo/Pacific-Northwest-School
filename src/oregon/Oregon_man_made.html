    <p> The Yaquina Head Lighthouse, a historic landmark on Oregon's central coast, commands attention with its towering presence, standing 93 feet above sea level. 
      Its classic white cylindrical tower, adorned with a spiraling black stripe, is crowned by a distinctive black lantern room, a beacon of maritime history dating back to its construction in 1873. 
      For over a century, this lighthouse has faithfully guided ships through the perilous waters of the Pacific Ocean, its powerful beam of light piercing through the darkness of night. Situated within the picturesque Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area, 
      visitors are treated to panoramic views of the rugged coastline, where tide pools teem with marine life and cliffs are relentlessly pounded by the crashing waves. 
      Beyond its practical function, the lighthouse symbolizes Oregon's rich maritime heritage, inviting travelers to explore its grounds, climb its tower for breathtaking vistas, and immerse themselves in its timeless charm and scenic beauty. </p>
