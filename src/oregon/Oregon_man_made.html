    <p> Perched atop Oregon's rugged coast, Yaquina Head Lighthouse has stood since 1873, guiding ships with its classic design and striking presence. 
      Inside, visitors step into history, climbing to the lantern room for sweeping views of the Pacific. 
      Surrounded by wildlife and coastal beauty, it's a timeless symbol of maritime heritage. </p>
